# Restaurant App Demo Front-End

This was my final project for the 11-50 academy red badge course. The goal of this project was to demonstrate full CRUD while using additional technologies which included, but were not limited to React.js, Typescript, Node.js. 

This README details the front-end portion of this project. The React.js application has three key differentiators:

1) Customers
2) Restaurants
3) Administrators

Upon registration, users are able to select if they would like to be considered business owners. Business owners have administrative capabilites which allows them to create, edit or update restaurants. Business owners can create, edit or delete comments they've created. Standard customers are allowed to create, edit or delete comments. Business owners are only allowed to view and manage their restaurants. Customers can comment on restaurants made by any business owner.

This application was built on create-react-app, material UI & Typescript. Portions of this project are actively being converted to Typescript as time permits. Users can navigate between the home screen, sign up and sign in views.

Some of the technologies used to build this front-end include:

* [Create React App with Typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/example/basic)

Additional npm technologies can be viewed in the package.json file listed.
